## The Birth of staycy

Hello Friend,

At the time of writing this post (03 Jan 2024) I have around three years of experience in cybersecurity working as a cybersecurity consultant.

Although I do okay at work, I have a hidden feeling. More like a hidden fear that I will fall back and become slowly irrelevant.  A lot of stuff seem foreign to me. There are a lot of things that I do not understand and the anxiety it generates isn't helping me as well. I do have a few entry level certifications, I am aiming for more including the notorious and so called "Beginner cert" OSCP.

I see chasing certifications alone won't help me in the long run. 

I feel making learning a chore has sucked out the joy of learning that I had as a college student and during my early days in cyber. The fun seems to have been lost. Learning never felt overwhelming or exhausting before.

This is an attempt to try something with my learning.  I do not want it to be a chore, an obligation. Not something out of desperation.

Finding different ways to apply and share and keep the process of learning fresh.

To **STAY** alive and thrive in **CY**bersecurity
